# Simple-Linear-Regression-for-predicting-CO2EMISSIONS of differnt car models-

## Overview

This project involves performing a simple linear regression analysis using Python. The goal is to understand the relationship between a dependent variable and an independent variable, predict outcomes, and evaluate the model's performance.

## Project Structure

- `Simple Linear Regression.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for performing simple linear regression analysis.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset used for analysis (ensure the data is placed here before running the notebook).
- `README.md`: Project documentation and instructions.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages required for the project.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
